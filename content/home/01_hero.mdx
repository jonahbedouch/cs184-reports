# CS 184 Zen Group

This is the website that [Jonah Alex Bedouch](mailto:bedouch@berkeley.edu)
and [Brandon James Wong](mailto:) are using to host 184 project reports in web
form. Each project also has a PDF available on the source page, which is what we
submitted for the project on Gradescope.

The source code for this website itself is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/jonahbedouch/cs184-reports), but it is a
cut down and re-themed version of [Jonah's portfolio](https://bedouch.net).
It is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and hosted with
[Vercel](https://vercel.com). The project writeups are written in Markdown,
and converted into a PDF using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) with the
[Typst](https://typst.dev) render engine and a custom template. The raw markdown
is then rendered using MDX on this page to create the web version.
