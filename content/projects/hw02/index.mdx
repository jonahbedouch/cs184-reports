# Project Overview
In this project, we worked with bezier curves and triangle meshes in order to learn
different ways to render surfaces. We began by simply implementing the algorithm that
allows us to render a bezier curve, then we extended this to cover bezier surfaces, a
way of using bezier curves in order to render entire 3D models. From there, we pivoted
to a more advanced meshing method, triangle meshes. Using a half-edge data structure
that was provided to us, we implemented a function to find the area-weighted vertex
normal of every vertex, allowing us to effectively do Phong shading. After this, we
implemented a basic local mesh operation called edge flipping, which allowed us to
flip the direction of any one edge in order to improve the feel of our triangle mesh
locally. After this, we implemented the Edge Split operation, which adds a vertex at
the midpoint of an edge, and then creates new triangles by bridging this new
vertex to nearby existing vertices with new edges. Finally, we combine all of the
work that we've done with triangle meshes to implement mesh subdivision, a global
technique of improving the quality of a mesh by subdividing it into smaller triangles
whose areas are weighted dependent on the specific shape of the mesh before subdivision.
As it turns out, implementing this operation primarily consists of some clever math and
the use of our local optimizations, which allowed us to take our local improvements and
use them to provide a global improvement in mesh quality.

# Section 1: Bezier Curves and Surfaces

## Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision
The way de Casteljau’s algorithm works at each step is by looping through all the available points
at the current level and finding the point between each pair of points in order. This means between
the first and second points, second and third points, and so on until the second to last and last
points. This point between each pair of points would be weighted by values 1 - t for the first one
and t for the second one, with t depending on how far on the generated bezier curve the point you
are searching for is at a value between 0 and 1, with 0 being the beginning of the curve and 1 being
the end of the curve. Part 1 is the implementation of this step, which then gets run on loop at each
level to find the corresponding point t on the curve. This repeated running on each level is then run
for each point in the curve to find the overall bezier curve. The results of a custom curve are shown
below.

## Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau
By classifying the points into rows and columns, de Casteljau’s algorithm can be implemented on 3D points
as well as 2D points. First, the bezier curve of each row can be found individually. Then by taking one
point per row where each point is in the same column, the actual bezier curve can be found for each
column, resulting in a 3D bezier surface. This was split into 3 parts in the actual implementation, one to
find the resulting points in each step similar to the step function in the previous section, one to find
the vector of 3D points that make up one bezier curve, and one to find the final point from a bezier curve
along the curves in the other direction generated previously. This enables the generation of the 3D surface
teapot shown below.

## Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals
To implement area-weighted vertex normals, we got the corresponding halfedge to the
desired vertex, and then looped through until we reached the same vertex again. Each
iteration, we grabbed the current face, got the face's normal, normlaized it, and
then accumulated it into a variable called `face_normals`. After getting the face, we
found the twin of the halfedge and then got the next value of that twin, since this
would guarantee that we move on to the next face. At the very end, we divide the
`face_normals` vector by the number of faces we ended up finding in our loop, and
return this final number as our area-weighted vertex normal. We can see the result of
this with Phong shading in the following images:

## Part 4: Edge Flip
We implemented the edge flip operation by drawing out the necessary flips on a whiteboard,
producing the following mess:

![Whiteboarding out Part 4](./part4workplan.jpg "Whiteboarding out Part 4")

Here, we drew out the initial and final set of vertices, edges, faces, and half edges. From there,
we identified all of the changes that needed to happen to make a flip work out, and then pseudo-coded
the flip on the whiteboard. Because of the level of scaffolding we did beforehand, the implementation
was somewhat smooth, but a fun debugging story that we had is that we were incorrectly initializing our
`EdgeIter` variables as `EdgeIter&`, which we spent rougly 3 hours debugging since all of our logic was
otherwise correct, but the code would hang as a result instead of flipping, and we could not figure out
why. We eventually asked someone on staff who noticed basically immediately.

Our implementation doesn't have a lot of interesting things, for the most part we just mapped out all
of the changes and did them. The way that we made this easier to conceptualize is that we based all of
our variables off of the `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` from our diagram, and made everything relative to the single
half edge we circled (since no matter which half edge is selected, everything is the same relative to the
selected edge).

The result is below:

## Part 5: Edge Split
To do part 5, we created a spreadsheet containing each object we would be interacting with in the split, old
and new. This means we put in all 12 of the inner halfedges, all 8 edges, all 5 vertices, and all 4 faces.
For the half edges, we made a table showing what each half edge object contained both before and after the split.
For all the other objects, we just put down what they would be pointing to after the split, as they are less
complicated than the halfedges. This made implementation simple. First, we obtained all of the relevant old
objects from the initial edge used as input. Then, We created all the new objects we would need. Finally, we
assigned the new pointers to each object such that they pointed to what they would need to after the split. For
the non half edge objects, we assigned them as they were obtained and generated once all the values that needed
to be obtained from them were obtained as they are much simpler than the half edge objects. The table is shown below.

![Splitting Before](./part5before.png "Splitting Before")
![Splitting After](./part5after.png "Splitting After")


To handle boundary edges, we added a checker that would figure out which half edge was the boundary edge (if there was
one) and would assign the non-boundary edge to the same variable each time, which meant we would not have to keep track
of it later. Then, we set the objects that would be on the boundary side if the edge was a boundary edge to point to
boundary things by default, and then set if statements that would have them point to the normal things if the edge was
not a boundary edge. These results are shown below.

![Boundary Before](./part5ecbefore.png "Boundary Before")
![Boundary After](./part5ecafter.png "Boundary After")

Debugging was both simpler and odder than in part 4. For this part, I kept getting a segfault after the function would
finish running that would crash everything. I tried to use print statements throughout the code to check where the error
was, which was how I detected the segfaults. In the process, I realized that I was assigning a couple of things wrong, but
it turns out those were not causing the segfault. I also switched from deleting things to just reassigning, but again,
that wasn't what was causing the issue (although it did help for the next part). Finally, I realized I was creating new
objects wrong, as I had not realized there were dedicated new functions. Thankfully, there were no more issues after that
(except a wrong face that would not be noticed until part 6 due to not causing any obvious issues).

## Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling

To implement loop subdividing, we rely on a few loops. First, we loop through the vertex set and
the edge set in order to set all of the flags about new meshes to false. Then, we loop through the
vertex set and calculate all of the new positions according to where all of the adjacent vertices
are located (we follow the given formula from the spec). Then, we loop through the set of edges and
base the position of the edge splits on the four surrounding vertices to the edge. We note both
of these in the `newPosition` fields of the vertex and edge structs respectively. Next, we add all
of our current edges to an array, which allows us to iterate through them without worrying about
the addition of new verticies (we tried  to do this in place, but we kept running into errors and
eventually switched to this method to rule out any chance of error as a result of the loop). As we
loop through all of the old edges, we split the edge, mark the new vertex as new, and update the
`newPosition` of the vertex to match the `newPosition` that was on the edge. Then, we adjust the
`isNew` value of the corresponding vertices that were created. We make sure only to mark the
vertices which are not alonog the preexisting line as new, so that in our next iteration there is
no chance that we attempt to flip them. Next, we loop again through our edges, flipping any edge
that is marked as new and has at most one of its two vertices marked as new. Finally, we loop
through all of the verticies and copy `v->newPosition` into `v->position`. Since we set the vertex
position to the edge position earlier, we can just do this in a single pass.

The result of loop subdivision is that vertices in the middle that are not along jagged edges smooth
out very quickly, while jagged edges or corners take longer to resolve themselves. We can see this in
the result of the cube, where the more iterations we go, the fewer vertices are actually along a jagged
line, resulting in more uniformity, but in the first few iterations we see something that's quite spikey
on the outside and more okay in the middle:

| &nbsp;                                                            | &nbsp;                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Box, no subdivisions](./part6loop0.png "Box, no subdivisions")  | ![Box, 1 subdivision](./part6loop1.png "Box, 1 subdivision")  |
| ![Box, 2 subdivisions](./part6loop2.png "Box, 2 subdivisions")    | ![Box, 3 subdivision](./part6loop3.png "Box, 3 subdivisions") |
| ![Box, 4 subdivisions](./part6loop4.png "Box, 4 subdivisions")    | ![Box, 5 subdivision](./part6loop5.png "Box, 5 subdivisions") |
| ![Box, 6 subdivisions](./part6loop6.png "Box, 6 subdivisions")    | ![Box, 7 subdivision](./part6loop7.png "Box, 7 subdivisions") |

We notice that this effect can be minimized to an extent by adding more subdivisions near the
edges themselevs. For instance, in the box case, we can add the following pattern and observe
the result after 3 iterations:

| &nbsp;                                                                | &nbsp;                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ![Box, split pattern](./part6sub.png "Box, split pattern")            | ![SP Box, 1 subdivision](./part6sub2.png "SP Box, 1 subdivision")  |
| ![SP Box, 2 subdivisions](./part6sub3.png "SP Box, 2 subdivisions")   | ![SP Box, 3 subdivision](./part6sub4.png "SP Box, 3 subdivisions") |

We see that the each iteration is much faster to conform to a rounded pattern, and by iteration 3 it
is hard to notice any chunkinng (which we still could see visibly on the first one). This is because
we have reduced the number of sharp edges, so when we subdivide, the vertices that we average to find
the position of new vertices are no longer following a single line that skews the data in one direction.
Instead, there is some variance resulting in vertex placement that looks more natural and conforms to
the subdivision faster.

Now, in terms of allowing the cube to subdivide symetrically, we observe in the above set of images
that the cube is skewed along one axis. If we pay attention, we see the result is a more oblong cuboid
on the vertices where there is not directly an edge bisecting them. This makes sense, because the vertex
that results from the split and flip operation will be weighted along the closer vertices in the corners
where there is actually an existing edge, and will not on the other edges, resulting in an oblong
appearance. We can easily resolve this by making the mesh edges symmetrical. That is, by splitting the
one edge that runs through the cube into a cross pattern, we can force the new vertices to be evenly spaced
along all four corners, resulting in a symmetric cube. This effect can be seen below:

| &nbsp;                                                                             | &nbsp;                                                                         |

### Extra Credit

Since we implemented boundary splitting in Part 5, we figured that we might as well implement boundary splitting in Q6 as well.
Very little had to be changed from our Q5 and 6 implementations on their own, except for a single calcuation. When computing the
position of our new edges, we check to see if either halfedge is on a boundary. If so, instead of attempting to compute the
interpolated point based on a weighted average of our two directions, we simply place the point halfway between the two already
existing boundary verticies. In doing this, we avoid the strange waving effect that appears by default when subdividing boundary
edges with the previous ratios. This can be seen working on the beetle mesh below:
